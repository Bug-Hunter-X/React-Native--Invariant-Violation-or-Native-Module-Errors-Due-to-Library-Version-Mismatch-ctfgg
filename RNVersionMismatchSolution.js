The solution involves carefully examining the third-party library's documentation to determine its compatibility with your React Native version.  You might need to:

1. **Update the library:** Use npm or yarn to upgrade the library to a version explicitly supporting your React Native release.
```javascript
npm install <library-name>@<compatible-version>
```
2. **Update React Native:** Upgrade your React Native version to one supported by the library (less preferred since it can break other parts of your project).
3. **Use a compatible library:** If neither of the above is feasible, find an alternative library compatible with your setup.
4. **Version Pinning:** Use the correct version pinning operator in your package.json (caret ^ for latest minor/patch updates, tilde ~ for latest patch updates) 
5. **Clean and Rebuild:** Clean your project's cache and reinstall packages. 
```javascript
yarn cache clean --force && yarn install
```
By carefully managing versions and utilizing appropriate version pinning, you can mitigate this type of error.
