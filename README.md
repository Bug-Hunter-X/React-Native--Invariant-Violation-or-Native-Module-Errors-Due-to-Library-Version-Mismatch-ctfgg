# React Native: Addressing Third-Party Library Version Incompatibilities

This repository demonstrates a common React Native issue: errors stemming from version mismatches between your project and third-party libraries. The problem is often masked by generic error messages, making debugging challenging.  This example shows how to identify and resolve such conflicts.

## The Problem
The `RNVersionMismatchBug.js` file showcases code that attempts to use a library incompatible with the current React Native version.  This could manifest as an `Invariant Violation` or failures in native module loading.

## The Solution
The `RNVersionMismatchSolution.js` file illustrates how to solve the issue. This involves:

1. **Carefully checking the library's documentation:** Determine the supported React Native versions.
2. **Updating dependencies:** Ensure your `package.json` lists compatible versions.
3. **Using version pinning:** Employ `^` (caret) or `~` (tilde) appropriately in `package.json` to control version updates.
4. **Cleaning the cache and reinstalling dependencies:** `yarn cache clean --force && yarn install` (or npm equivalent). 
5. **Considering alternative libraries:** If updating is not an option, look for alternatives.

This example provides a practical understanding of a frequent and often frustrating React Native development challenge.
