This error occurs when using a third-party library that expects a specific React Native version but your project is using a different one.  It can also happen if there's a mismatch in dependencies, or if the library isn't fully compatible with the current React Native version.  The error message itself might not always clearly pinpoint the incompatibility. You might see generic errors like `Invariant Violation` or errors related to native modules not being found.
